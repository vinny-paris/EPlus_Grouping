The iterative side is almost done, I need to make sure that the third, fourth, etc...iterarations work like they should. I also have eplusr working on my mac which is good and is producing results that I expect. Once I figure out how to edit parameters (which I think won't be too difficult once I understand the package a bit better) I should be, in effect, done with serial portion. That is predicated on being able to navigate that package though. I will then need to start thinking about how to move all these files onto cades and make sure it reads them in the correct order.
