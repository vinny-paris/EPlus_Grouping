Grouping is done. I have a wrapping function that takes in certain parameters and returns both the full grouping variables of interest and a large collection that is useful for a fractional factorial situation. All that is needed is to actually produce the responses as the treatements are fed in. Currently it is just producig rnorm noise. The next step in the process is to get the eplusr package working for me including editiing the idf files and running the programs directly. Weather needs to be decided upon as well.
