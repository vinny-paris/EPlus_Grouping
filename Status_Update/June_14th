June 14th: Grouping is almost complete. I have given up on the idea of using the R package clustering and have decided to go more on my own path. I have a system of functions set up such that I have a metric of correlation between any two pairs of variables. I still need to translate that into specific groups. After groups are assigned the design matrix can be finished quickly (old code I have can do it quickly). I will then need to automate this whole process which should not be bad. All (new) functions I have built are made to feed into the next. 

Goals in order: Finish grouping, sew my old and new code together, automate, tie in with Joshua New (and friends) code, analyizer for after running the EP-models (Lenth's Method), automate an iterative process for next group stage, parallelize it, run the whole shooting match, celebrate
